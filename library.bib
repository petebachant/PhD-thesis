  Abstract                 = {The present study deals with the efficiency of cross flow water current turbine for free stream conditions versus power farm conditions. In the first part, a single turbine for free fluid flow conditions is considered. The simulations are carried out with a new in house code which couples a Navier–Stokes computation of the outer flow field with a description of the inner flow field around the turbine. The latter is based on experimental results of a Darrieus wind turbine in an unbounded domain. This code is applied for the description of a hydraulic turbine. In the second part, the interest of piling up several turbines on the same axis of rotation to make a tower is investigated. Not only is it profitable because only one alternator is needed but the simulations demonstrate the advantage of the tower configuration for the efficiency. The tower is then inserted into a cluster of several lined up towers which makes a barge. Simulations show that the average barge efficiency rises as the distance between towers is decreased and as the number of towers is increased within the row. Thereby, the efficiency of a single isolated turbine is greatly increased when set both into a tower and into a cluster of several towers corresponding to possible power farm arrangements.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper attempts to quantify the effects of array layout on the performance of offshore wind farms. Array layout is characterized by the spacing between wind turbines (along and across the prevailing wind direction) and by their alignment (aligned or staggered). A large-eddy simulation code is utilized to create a turbulent boundary layer and is coupled with an actuator line model to simulate the effects of the rotating wind turbine blades. A control case (simulating the Lillgrund farm) and sensitivity runs are performed with various combinations of increased spacing, with and without staggering. Staggering every second row was found to be the simplest method to improve the capacity factor from 0.3 to 0.34 and array losses from 36% to 27%. The highest capacity factor (0.4) and the lowest array losses (14%) were obtained with a staggered layout with spacing across the prevailing wind direction that was twice the original. Smart layout choices can improve the array performance by 13%–33%.},

  Abstract                 = {The aerodynamics of a high solidity vertical axis wind turbine was investigated through wind tunnel tests of a full size turbine operating at Reynolds numbers of Re  500,000 (where the power production has been shown to be Re independent). Flow visualization using light-weight tufts attached to the inner surface of a blade was used to gain insight on the operating aerodynamics, which is related to the measured power performance. The tufts proved to be an effective and simple technique to observe the flow characteristics on the large scales involved where other flow measurement techniques like particle image velocimetry or laser Doppler velocimetry would be challenging and expensive. Straight blades on the HeDarrieus turbine operating at peak power showed large regions of flow separation on the upwind blade pass extending from early in the upwind pass from an azimuthal angle q ¼ 40e50 (where the blade is moving directly upwind at q ¼ 0) to over 60 into the downwind pass. The effect of preset blade pitch was also investigated where a 6 leading edge toe-out pitch showed a delay in separation initiation and a reduction in the maximum fraction of chord with flow reversal as well as increased power performance. The overall separation behaviour of the straight blades shows the importance of dynamic stall and the interaction of the separated vortex with the blade as mechanisms in lift generation. Performance and flow separation results are presented for canted blades. The flow separation behaviour was considerably different from straight blades, with canted blades experiencing less flow reversal on their upwind pass, and recovering attached flow before q ¼ 180. The installation of fences on the canted blades increased the power and reduced the blade speed ratio at which peak power occurred, suggestive of a reduction in spanwise flow on the swept blades (so that they locally behave more like straight blades). However, the location and amount of flow separation did not trend toward that seen with the straight blades, but rather the fences further reduced the amount of separation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new computational model for initial sizing and performance prediction of vertical axis wind turbines is presented. The model uses a 2D hybrid dynamic vortex and blade element momentum approach. Each airfoil is modeled as a single vortex of time varying strength with an analytical model for the influence of the shed vorticity. The vortex strengths are calculated by imposing a flow tangency condition at the three-quarter chord location on each airfoil, modified in the case of stall. The total blade forces and the momentum-based streamtube deceleration are then obtained using pre-computed c[subscript d] and c[subscript m] 2D blade profile characteristics. Model fidelity is improved over previous models because flow curvature, dynamic vortices, blade interactions, static stall, and streamtube changes are all taken into account. Fast convergence is obtained for a large range of solidity and tip speed ratio, which allows optimization of various parameters, including blade pitch angle variation.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of cavitation tunnel and tank tests on an 800 mm diameter model of a marine current turbine (MCT) are presented. The tests were carried out in a 2.4 m x 1.2 m cavitation tunnel and the 60 m towing tank. Results for power and thrust coefﬁcients are presented for a range of tip speed ratio and pitch settings for various conditions. The results of this investigation provided an insight into the operation of a singe turbine in straight or yawed ﬂow, the effect on performance of changes in the tip immersion of the rotor, the interference between twin rotors and the likely areas of cavitation inception. In addition, the analysed results presented provide useful information for the hydrodynamic design of MCTs and detailed data for the validation of numerical models.},

  Abstract                 = {The second law aspects of heat transfer by forced convection are illustrated in terms of four fundamental flow configurations: pipe flow, boundary layer over flat plate, single cylinder in cross-flow, flow in the entrance region of a flat rectangular duct. The interpla_, between irreversibility due to heat transfer along finite temperature gradients and, on the other hand, irreversibility due to viscous effects is analyzed in detail. The spatial distribution of irreversibility, entropy generation profiles or maps, and those flow features acting as strong sources of irreversibility are presented. It is shown how the flow geometric parameters may be selected in order to minimize the irreversibility associated with a specific convective heat transfer process.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an analysis technique for investigating the effects of gyroscopic couples on the behaviour of a large vertical axis wind turbine mounted on a floating semi-submersible vessel. Equations of motion in 6 degrees of freedom are formulated in the frequency domain. Time domain aerodynamic loads are derived from a double multiple stream tube model based Paraschivoiu [13]. These loads are transposed to the frequency domain and integrated with a formulation of the gyroscopic moments acting for the wind turbine rotating and the semi-submersible rotating in roll and pitch due to ocean waves. The paper uses this model to explore the effect of gyroscopic effects on the motions of the turbine and semisubmersible. It is shown that the gyroscopic effect has negligible effects on some modes of motion but that it introduces significant motions at key frequencies related to rotor speed.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that when wind turbines are deployed in large arrays, their efficiency decreases due to complex interactions among themselves and with the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For wind farms whose length exceeds the height of the ABL by over an order of magnitude, a “fully developed” flow regime can be established. In this asymptotic regime, changes in the streamwise direction can be neglected and the relevant exchanges occur in the vertical direction. Such a fully developed wind-turbine array boundary layer (WTABL) has not been studied systematically before. A suite of large eddy simulations (LES), in which wind turbines are modeled using the classical “drag disk” concept, is performed for various wind-turbine arrangements, turbine loading factors, and surface roughness values. The results are used to quantify the vertical transport of momentum and kinetic energy across the boundary layer. It is shown that the vertical fluxes of kinetic energy are of the same order of magnitude as the power extracted by the forces modeling the wind turbines. In the fully developed WTABL, the kinetic energy extracted by the wind turbines is transported into the wind-turbine region by vertical fluxes associated with turbulence. The results are also used to develop improved models for effective roughness length scales experienced by the ABL. The effective roughness scale is often used to model wind-turbine arrays in simulations of atmospheric dynamics at larger (regional and global) scales. The results from the LES are compared to several existing models for effective roughness lengths. Based on the observed trends, a modified model is proposed, showing improvement in the predicted effective roughness length.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study is to introduce and demonstrate a fully automated process for optimizing the airfoil cross-section of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). The objective is to maximize the torque while enforcing typical wind turbine design constraints such as tip speed ratio, solidity, and blade prole. Byxing the tip speed ratio and solidity of the wind turbine, there exists an airfoil cross-section for which the torque can be maximized, requiring the development of an iterative design system. The design system required to maximize torque incorporates rapid geometry generation and automated hybrid mesh generation tools with viscous, unsteady computational uid dynamics (CFD) simulation software. The exibility and automation of the modular design and simulation system allows for it to easily be coupled with a parallel dierential evolution algorithm used to obtain an optimized blade design that maximizes the eciency of the wind turbine.},

  Abstract                 = {A wind tunnel experiment has been performed to quantify the Reynolds number dependence of turbulence statistics in the wake of a model wind turbine. A wind turbine was placed in a boundary layer flow developed over a smooth surface under thermally neutral conditions. Experiments considered Reynolds numbers on the basis of the turbine rotor diameter and the velocity at hub height, ranging from Re D 1:66 104 to 1:73 105 . Results suggest that main flow statistics (mean velocity, turbulence intensity, kinematic shear stress and velocity skewness) become independent of Reynolds number starting from Re 9:3 104 . In general, stronger Reynolds number dependence was observed in the near wake region where the flow is strongly affected by the aerodynamics of the wind turbine blades. In contrast, in the far wake region, where the boundary layer flow starts to modulate the dynamics of the wake, main statistics showed weak Reynolds dependence. These results will allow us to extrapolate wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamic simulations, which often are conducted at lower Reynolds numbers, to full-scale conditions. In particular, these findings motivates us to improve exist- ing parameterizations for wind turbine wakes (e.g. velocity deficit, wake expansion, turbulence intensity) under neutral conditions and the predictive capabilities of atmospheric large eddy simulation models.},

In order to improve the performance of a marine current turbine it is necessary accurately to model the flow passing the turbine’s blades. Several types of models exist for Darrieus-type turbines, from momentum-based streamtube models to complex computational fluids dynamics (CFD) simulations. With continuously varying large angles of attack on the blades, the main issue is accurate prediction of the flow field around the rotor and thus its loads and torque. This is further complicated by the significant inherent unsteady hydrodynamic characteristics and potential for dynamic stall. Comparisons of the analytical results with experimental data are presented to compare these different models and thus illustrate their areas of suitability in this context. In conclusion, vertical axis machines have the potential of high power capture compared with that of their horizontal counterparts but this will depend on blade profile and design configuration, solidity, and tip speed ratio. None of the existing theoretical methods really captures the actual performance of the machines except for detailed CFD simulations, which are inevitably computational time intensive.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents developments in numerical simulations of a cross-flow vertical-axis marine current turbine (straight-bladed Darrieus type) with particular emphasis on rotor-performance prediction and hydrodynamic loads for structural design calculations. This study initially used theoretical double-multiple-streamtube models, followed by physical testing on a scaled-down model turbine and primarily numerical simulations. Numerical investigations of a proposed full-scale turbine (power coefficient, blade loads and flow behaviour) were undertaken using the developed computational models. The turbine design was studied using a time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) commercial solver. A transient-rotor-stator model with a moving mesh technique was used to capture the change in flow field at a particular time step. A shear stress-transport kÿ! turbulence model was used to model turbulent features of the flow. The numerical results show good agreement with experimental measurements and the theoretical double-multiple-streamtube model. Turbine sensitivity to parametric variations was also demonstrated in the full-scale numerical study. This work concludes that the developed model can effectively predict hydrodynamic performance and structural design blade loads of a vertical-axis marine current turbine.},

The model is suitable for fast aerodynamic and aeroelastic coupling calculations. It determines the inviscid pressure distribution in the vicinity of one blade and the force on the blade in arbitrary two dimensional motion. The method is more flexible than previous analysis: it can represent any profile, pitching motion and blade attachment position. The method is based on conformal mapping techniques and Laurent’s series decomposition and is faster and more accurate than standard panel methods. A main idea is to directly treat the singularities of the flow in a mapped plane where any geometrical plane is simplified to a circle. The vorticity is assumed to be shed in the form of a continuous vortex sheet near the trailing edge.},

  Abstract                 = {Wave loads are one of the main contributors to fatigue loads of tidal turbine blades. Because of this, they are a determinant parameter for calculation of turbine blade life time. To avoid cost associated with oversizing blades or replacing a damaged blade, it is essential to evaluate the loads acting on the turbine, and especially wave loads on the blades, with the best possible accuracy. Experience from wind industry is valuable for horizontal axis tidal turbine design and loads acting on the blade can be estimated using the same methods, even if the loads are different. This article presents the main features of a code written with Matlab, able to predict thrust force and torque on each blade while the turbine is operating in a regular wave field. The quasi-static Blade Element Momentum theory is combined here with an added mass force modeling. The linear wave theory is employed to describe the water particle velocity due to waves. This velocity is, as a first approximation, simply added to a uniform stream velocity to account for wave-current interaction. The analytical results are validated by comparing them with experimental data obtained by testing a 1.475m-diameter rotor towed in a 260m-long wave tank, for different combinations of current speeds and wave characteristics. This emphasizes the importance of wave effects and dynamics in the design of tidal turbine blades.},

  Abstract                 = {The present work contains theoretical considerations and computational results on the nature of using winglets on wind turbines. The theoretical results presented show that the power augmentation obtainable with winglets is due to a reduction of tip-effects, and is not, as believed up to now, caused by the downwind vorticity shift due to downwind winglets. The numerical work includes optimization of the power coefficient for a given tip speed ratio and geometry of the span using a newly developed free wake lifting line code, which takes into account also viscous effects and self induced forces. Validation of the new code with CFD results for a rotor without winglets showed very good agreement. Results from the new code with winglets indicate that downwind winglets are superior to upwind ones with respect to optimization of Cp, and that the increase in power production is less than what may be obtained by a simple extension of the wing in the radial direction. The computations also show that shorter downwind winglets (>2%) come close to the increase in Cp obtained by a radial extension of the wing. Lastly, the results from the code are used to design a rotor with a 2% downwind winglet, which is computed using the Navier-Stokes solver EllipSys3D. These computations show that further work is needed to validate the FWLL code for cases where the rotor is equipped with winglets.},

  Abstract                 = {In a 2003 test campaign in the DLR-VAG test stand unsteady pressure distributions during dynamic stall have been measured on a 2D-wing model with OA312 airfoil section. To investigate the effect of transition on dynamic stall onset different tripping devices have been fixed at the leading edge of the model. Adhesive tapes of different thickness as well as corundum with various grains have been used as tripping material. In addition to the experiments numerical calculations have been carried out based on the solution of the unsteady 2D-RANS-equations including a turbulence and transition model. In the present investigation it is shown that different physical flow phenomena can be identified which are triggering the onset procedure of dynamic stall. Three different flow-scenarios have been studied in detail: (1) Free transition during dynamic stall, (M = 0.2). (2) Fully turbulent flow, (M = 0.2). (3) Flow at M = 0.4, compressibility effects. Unsteady measured and calculated pressures have been compared for these cases and good agreement has been found. The calculations then are used for detailed flow investigations including the development of leading edge separation bubbles as well as trailing edge separation areas.  2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

  Abstract                 = {Tidal currents can be used as a predictable source of sustainable energy, and have the potential to make a useful contribution to the energy needs of the UK and other countries with such a resource. One of the technologies which may be used to transform tidal power into mechanical power is a vertical axis turbine, the hydrodynamic analysis of which this thesis is concerned with. The aim of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of the power transformation process, from which position there is the possibility of improving the conversion efficiency. A second aim is to compare the results from different modelling approaches. Two types of mathematical modelling are used: a basic blade element momentum model and a more complex Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model. The former model has been programmed in Matlab by the present author while the latter model uses a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, ANSYS CFX. This RANS model uses the SST k-ω turbulence model. The CFD analysis of hydrofoils (equally airfoils), for both fixed and oscillating pitch conditions, is a significant proportion of the present work. Such analysis is used as part of the verification and validation of the CFD model of the turbine. It is also used as input to the blade element momentum model, thereby permitting a novel comparison between the blade element momentum model and the CFD model of the turbine. Both types of turbine model were used to explore the variation in turbine efficiency (and other factors) with tip speed ratio and with and without an angle of attack limiting variable pitch strategy. It is shown that the use of such a variable pitch strategy both increases the peak efficiency and broadens the peak. The comparison of the results from the two different turbine modelling approaches shows that when the present CFD hydrofoil results are used as input to the blade element model, and when dynamic effects are small and the turbine induction factor is low, there is generally good agreement between the two models.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess climate impacts of global warming using ongoing observations and paleoclimate data. We use Earth’s measured energy imbalance, paleoclimate data, and simple representations of the global carbon cycle and temperature to define emission reductions needed to stabilize climate and avoid potentially disastrous impacts on today’s young people, future generations, and nature. A cumulative industrial-era limit of ∼500 GtC fossil fuel emissions and 100 GtC storage in the biosphere and soil would keep climate close to the Holocene range to which humanity and other species are adapted. Cumulative emissions of ∼1000 GtC, sometimes associated with 2°C global warming, would spur “slow” feedbacks and eventual warming of 3–4°C with disastrous consequences. Rapid emissions reduction is required to restore Earth’s energy balance and avoid ocean heat uptake that would practically guarantee irreversible effects. Continuation of high fossil fuel emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice. Responsible policymaking requires a rising price on carbon emissions that would preclude emissions from most remaining coal and unconventional fossil fuels and phase down emissions from conventional fossil fuels.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a combined experimental and computational study into the aerodynamics and performance of a small scale vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). Wind tunnel tests were carried out to ascertain overall performance of the turbine and two- and three-dimensional unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were generated to help understand the aerodynamics of this performance. Wind tunnel performance results are presented for cases of different wind velocity, tip-speed ratio and solidity as well as rotor blade surface finish. It is shown experimentally that the surface roughness on the turbine rotor blades has a significant effect on performance. Below a critical wind speed (Reynolds number of 30,000) the performance of the turbine is degraded by a smooth rotor surface finish but above it, the turbine performance is enhanced by a smooth surface finish. Both two bladed and three bladed rotors were tested and a significant increase in performance coefficient is observed for the higher solidity rotors (three bladed rotors) over most of the operating range. Dynamic stalling behaviour and the resulting large and rapid changes in force coefficients and the rotor torque are shown to be the likely cause of changes to rotor pitch angle that occurred during early testing. This small change in pitch angle caused significant decreases in performance. The performance coefficient predicted by the two dimensional computational model is significantly higher than that of the experimental and the three-dimensional CFD model. The predictions show that the presence of the over tip vortices in the 3D simulations is responsible for producing the large difference in efficiency compared to the 2D predictions. The dynamic behaviour of the over tip vortex as a rotor blade rotates through each revolution is also explored in the paper.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to develop and test a set of general guidelines for choosing parameters to be used in the state-of-the-art actuator line method (ALM) for modeling wind turbine blades in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The actuator line method is being increasingly used for the computation of wake interactions in large wind farms in which fully blade-resolving simulations are expensive and require complicated rotating meshes. The focus is on actuator line behavior using fairly isotropic grids of low aspect ratio typically used for large-eddy simulation (LES). Forces predicted along the actuator lines need to be projected onto the flow field as body forces, and this is commonly accomplished using a volumetric projection. In this study, particular attention is given to the spanwise distribution of the radius of this projection. A new method is proposed where the projection radius varies along the blade span following an elliptic distribution. The proposed guidelines for actuator line parameters are applied to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Phase VI rotor and the NREL 5-MW turbine. Results obtained are compared with available data and the blade-element code XTurb-PSU. It is found that the new criterion for the projection radius leads to improved prediction of blade tip loads for both blade designs.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to control a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) in an optimal manner, one needs accurate measurements of the oncoming wind conditions. The method currently used by large wind power manufacturers is to measure wind speed and direction on top of the nacelle behind the rotor. In order for such measurements to give correct readings, a correction for the effect of rotor disturbance on the oncoming wind field is needed. This requires use of so-called nacelle transfer functions (NTF). An NTF is an empirical function that relates the undisturbed wind field to the measured wind speed and direction at the nacelle. Currently, the NTF is obtained through a series of costly and time consuming field measurement campaigns. The use of numerical methods, such as the one presented in this article, could both reduce the time needed to acquire an NTF and provide a means to improve NTF accuracy.

In this article, two different numerical models based on actuator disc and line techniques are implemented in Ansys CFX. The models are benchmarked against the Blade Element Momentum model (BEM) and against field measurements taken at the nacelle anemometer location of a Vestas V90 turbine. The overall agreement between the CFX actuator models and the reference data sources is found to be very satisfactory. The conclusion of the study is that the proposed models, in their current form, are suitable tools for research and development activities targeting nacelle anemometry or near wake aerodynamics. With some further development to include inflow turbulence and non-axial induction, the models have the potential to be used for generating a numerical NTF.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite much optimistic language on commercial websites, little data is available on actual performance of hydrokinetic turbines. This paper summarises the findings of a series of tests on several Darrieus type cross flow hydrokinetic turbines (HKTs). Although this type of hydrokinetic turbine (HKT) has some advantages over axial flow turbines, fixed pitch Darrieus HKTs also have some drawbacks, including inability to self-start under load, low efficiency and shaking. Variable pitch has been suggested to increase starting torque and efficiency, ducts to increase power output and helical blades to produce smooth torque. To assess each of these modifications, tests were conducted in Australia and Canada on HKTs with fixed and variable pitch straight blades, fixed helical blades, with and without a slatted diffuser, by mounting each turbine in front of a barge and motoring through still water at speeds ranging from less than 1 m/s up to 5 m/s. The diffuser increased the power output by a factor of 3 in one configuration but considerably less in others. A reason for this finding is suggested. The maximum coefficient of performance Cp of the fixed pitch straight blade and helical turbines without a diffuser ranged from about 0.25 at 1.5 m/s down to less than 0.1 at 5 m/s, while Cp for those with a diffuser ranged from about 0.45 down to about 0.3. Fixed blade turbines, both straight and helical, exhibited low starting torque, while variable pitch turbines started easily. Considerable differences in Cp were observed for the same turbine configuration at different speeds. The turbine with fixed pitch, straight blades was found to shake violently due to cyclical hydrodynamic forces on blades, while the helical and variable pitch turbines did not shake excessively. These findings suggest that variable pitch cross flow HKTs should be further investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {A semi-empirical model is formulated to represent the unsteady lift, drag, and pitching moment characteristics of an airfoil undergoing dynamic stall. The model is presented in a form which is consistent with an indicial formulation for the unsteady aerodynamics under attached flow conditions. The onset of vortex shedding during dynamic stall is represented using a criterion for leading edge or shock induced separation based on the attainment of a critical leading edge pressure. The induced vortex lift is represented empirically along with the associated pitching moment which is obtained by allowing the center of pressure to move in a time dependent manner during dynamic stall. Significant nonlinearities in the airfoil behavior associated with trailing edge separation are represented using a Kirchhoff flow model in which the separation point is related to the airfoil behavior. These effects are represented in such a way as to allow progressive transition between the dynamic stall and the static stall characteristics. It is shown how the above features may be implemented as an algorithm suitable for inclusion within rotorcraft airloads or aeroelasticity analyses. Validation of the model is presented with force and moment data from two-dimensional unsteady tests on the NACA 0012, HH-02, and SC-1095 airfoils.},

  Abstract                 = {The present experimental study focuses on the comparison between the wake of a two-bladed wind turbine and the one of an actuator disk. The flow field at the middle plane of the wake is measured with a stereoscopic particle image velocimetry setup, in the low-speed Open Jet Facility wind tunnel of the Delft University of Technology. The wind turbine wake is characterized by the complex dynamics of the tip vortex development and breakdown. Analysis of the flow statistics show anisotropic turbulent fluctuations in the turbine wake, with stronger components in the radial direction. The wake of the actuator disc is instead characterized by isotropic random fluctuations. The mixing process in the shear layer is further analysed in terms of flux of mean flow kinetic energy, to show the main differences between the kinetic energy entrainment in the actuator and the turbine wake. This project is intended to provide the basis for understanding the origin of the limitations of the current wake models based on the actuator disc assumption.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents some aspects concerning the 2D RANS numerical modeling of a Darrieus cross flow marine turbine. Two main features of the modeling are studied. The first deals with the influence of the near wall grid density on the numerical results. Most of the available literature concerning the occurrence of stalling foils emphasizes the need for a fine grid mesh at wall fitting yþ around the unity or less at the first near wall cell center. Nevertheless, in the case of a Darrieus turbine, the influence of this parameter has not yet been studied precisely. In particular, the exact yþ specification is not known, and its influence either on the global turbine performance or on the local flow field, has not been outlined. The present work provides insight into the yþ influence in a 2D Darrieus turbine and deals with its maximum acceptable value. The second feature concerns the ability of a 2D modeling to represent, the actual 3D flow in the turbine. The power coefficients CP are compared to those obtained in the hydrodynamic LEGI tunnel on a small scale model. The experimental power coefficients are presented with their associated precision. The comparisons show a medium tip speed ratio range around the nominal point for which the instantaneous ratio of the experimental and numerical power coefficients is a constant significantly lower than 1 regardless of the azimuthal position of the blades. This constant ratio is thought to be representative of the tip and arm-blade junctions losses.},

from two Large Eddy Simulation (LES) codes using the Actuator Line Model (ALM). The
study focuses on prediction of wind turbine wakes and their breakdown when subject to uniform
inflow. Previous studies have shown relative insensitivity to subgrid modeling in the context
of a finite-volume code. The present study uses the low dissipation pseudo-spectral LES code
from Johns Hopkins University (LESGO) and the second-order, finite-volume OpenFOAM code
(SOWFA) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. When subject to uniform inflow,
the loads on the blades are found to be unaffected by subgrid models or numerics, as expected.
The turbulence in the wake and the location of transition to a turbulent state are affected by
the subgrid-scale model and the numerics.},

  Abstract                 = {Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V&V in production and commercial software.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study undertakes an exergy and reliability analysis of wind turbine systems and applies to a local one in Turkey: the exergy performance and reliability of the small wind turbine generator have been evaluated in a demonstration (1.5 kW) in Solar Energy Institute of Ege University (latitude 38.24 N, longitude 27.50 E), Izmir, Turkey. In order to extract the maximum possible power, it is important that the blades of small wind turbines start rotating at the lowest possible wind speed. The starting performance of a three-bladed, 3 m diameter horizontal axis wind turbine was measured in ﬁeld tests. The average technical availability, real availability, capacity factor and exergy efﬁciency value have been analyzed from September 2002 to November 2003 and they are found to be 94.20%, 51.67%, 11.58%, and 0–48.72%, respectively. The reliability analysis has also been done for the small wind turbine generator. The failure rate is high to an extent of 2.28 x 10-4 h-1 and the factor of reliability is found to be 0.37 at 4380 h. If failure rate can be decreased, not only this system but also other wind turbine systems of real availability, capacity factor and exergy efﬁciency will be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the development of a large ﬁeld of view particle image velocimetry (LF-PIV) diagnostic, capable of resolving large-scale motions (>1 m per camera) in gas phase laboratory and ﬁeld experiments. While this diagnostic is developed for the measurement of wakes and local inﬂow conditions around research wind turbines, the design considerations provided here are also relevant for the application of LF-PIV to atmospheric boundary layer, rotorcraft dynamics and large-scale wind tunnel ﬂows. Measurements over an area of 0.75 m × 1.0 m on a conﬁned vortex were obtained using a standard 2MP camera, with the potential for increasing this area signiﬁcantly using 11MP cameras. The cameras in this case were oriented orthogonal to the measurement plane receiving only the side-scattered component of light from the particles. Scaling laws associated with LF-PIV systems are also presented along with the performance analysis of low-density, large diameter Expancel particles, that appear to be promising candidates for LF-PIV seeding.},

  Abstract                 = {Most numerical and experimental studies of the performance of vertical-axis wind turbines have been conducted with the rotors in steady, and thus somewhat artificial, wind conditions—with the result that turbine aerodynamics, under varying wind conditions, are still poorly understood. The vorticity transport model has been used to investigate the aerodynamic performance and wake dynamics, both in steady and unsteady wind conditions, of three different vertical-axis wind turbines: one with a straight-bladed configuration, another with a curved-bladed configuration and another with a helically twisted configuration. The turbines with non-twisted blades are shown to be somewhat less efficient than the turbine with helically twisted blades when the rotors are operated at constant rotational speed in unsteady wind conditions. In steady wind conditions, the power coefficients that are produced by both the straight-bladed and curved-bladed turbines vary considerably within one rotor revolution because of the continuously varying angle of attack on the blades and, thus, the inherent unsteadiness in the blade aerodynamic loading. These variations are much larger, and thus far more significant, than those that are induced by the unsteadiness in the wind conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that a wake will develop downstream of a tidal stream turbine owing to extraction of axial momentum across the rotor plane. To select a suitable layout for an array of horizontal axis tidal stream turbines, it is important to understand the extent and structure of the wakes of each turbine. Studies of wind turbines and isolated tidal stream turbines have shown that the velocity reduction in the wake of a single device is a function of the rotor operating state (specifically thrust), and that the rate of recovery of wake velocity is dependent on mixing between the wake and the surrounding flow. For an unbounded flow, the velocity of the surrounding flow is similar to that of the incident flow. However, the velocity of the surrounding flow will be increased by the presence of bounding surfaces formed by the bed and free surface, and by the wake of adjacent devices. This paper presents the results of an experimental study investigating the influence of such bounding surfaces on the structure of the wake of tidal stream turbines.},

  abstract =  {Cross flow turbines have a number of operational advantages for the conversion of kinetic energy in marine or fluvial currents, but they are often less efficient than axial flow devices. Here a control scheme is presented in which the angular velocity of a cross flow turbine with two straight blades is prescribed as a function of azimuthal blade position, altering the time-varying effective angle of attack. Flume experiments conducted with a scale model turbine show approximately an 80\% increase in turbine efficiency versus optimal constant angular velocity and constant resistive torque control schemes. Torque, drag, and lateral forces on one- and two-bladed turbines are analyzed and interpreted with bubble flow visualization to develop a simple model that describes the hydrodynamics responsible for the observed increase in mean efficiency. Challenges associated with implementing this control scheme on commercial-scale devices are discussed. If solutions are found, the performance increase presented here may impact the future development of cross flow turbines.},

Two sets of oscillating patterns with different frequencies, mean oscillating angles and amplitudes are numerically simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the results obtained are validated against the corresponding published experimental data. It is concluded that the CFD prediction captures well the vortex- shedding predominated flow structure which is experimentally obtained and the results quantitatively agree well with the experimental data, except when the blade is at a very high angle of attack.},

Three flight modes have been researched: fixed wing, rotary wing and flapping wing. For each mode, the literature in the public domain has been reviewed to obtain appropriate lift and drag coefficient data at these low Reynolds numbers. Energy and power requirements for the three flight modes have been calculated and an optimisation procedure has been utilised to evaluate the most efficient flight mode and configuration for a variety of specified missions. The effect of wind-speed on the optimal solution has been examined. It has been discovered that when there is no hover requirement, fixed wing flight is always most energy efficient for the micro air vehicle. However, if there is a hover requirement, the suitability of flapping or rotary wing flight is dependent on the mission profile and ambient windspeed.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-eddy simulation (LES), coupled with a wind-turbine model, is used to investigate the characteristics of a wind-turbine wake in a neutral turbulent boundary-layer flow. The tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) model is used for the parametrisation of the SGS stresses. The turbine-induced forces (e.g., thrust, lift and drag) are parametrised using two models: (a) the ‘standard’ actuator-disk model (ADMNR), which calculates only the thrust force and distributes it uniformly over the rotor area; and (b) the actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R), which uses the blade-element theory to calculate the lift and drag forces (that produce both thrust and rotation), and distribute them over the rotor disk based on the local blade and flow characteristics. Simulation results are compared to high-resolution measurements collected with hot-wire anemometry in the wake of a miniature wind turbine at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory atmospheric boundarylayer wind tunnel. In general, the characteristics of the wakes simulated with the proposed LES framework are in good agreement with the measurements in the far-wake region. The ADM-R yields improved predictions compared with the ADM-NR in the near-wake region, where including turbine-induced flow rotation and accounting for the non-uniformity of the turbine-induced forces appear to be important. Our results also show that the Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic SGS model is able to account, without any tuning, for the effects of local shear and flow anisotropy on the distribution of the SGS model coefficient.},
